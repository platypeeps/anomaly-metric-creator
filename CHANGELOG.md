# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added a `gpu_inference` component whose default CSV columns match the
  reference observability telemetry shape: batch/model size, GPU memory
  pressure, KV cache usage, memory fragmentation, utilization, throughput,
  p50/p99 latency, and failure label.
- Added the `gpu_inference_fragmentation` scenario to model the reference
  telemetry's sparse incident field: 1,204 failure minutes in the default
  50,000-row shape, mostly singleton runs, with imperfect but detectable lift
  from fragmentation, pressure, utilization, throughput, p99 latency, and KV
  cache occupancy.
- Added `--otel-gauges-only` to stream only OTLP Gauge metric payloads to
  `--otel-metrics-endpoint`, skipping the anomaly counter, log, and trace OTEL
  signal stream.
- Added HTTP failure diagnostics to `otel-activity.log` `RETRY` and `FAIL`
  records, including response headers, `cf_ray` when present, and the original
  JSON request body for JSON OTEL requests.

### Changed

- Changed the CLI defaults to match the reference CSV shape: 50,000 rows at a
  60-second interval, using a fractional default `--duration-days` value of
  about 34.72 days.
- Kept OTEL HTTP failure stderr output compact while moving the larger
  response-header and payload diagnostics into the activity log.
- In gauge-only mode, the gauge streamer starts a fresh activity log instead
  of appending to stale records from a prior signal-stream run.

### Tests

- Added parser and end-to-end coverage for `--otel-gauges-only`.
- Added HTTP failure coverage for anomaly metrics and gauge metrics to verify
  Cloudflare IDs, response headers, and JSON request payloads are logged only
  in the activity log.
